```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Editing & Visual Development

This project includes a comprehensive UI editing workflow with visual validation:

### Quick Start
```bash
# Take before screenshot
npm run ui:before

# Make your UI changes
# ... edit components ...

# Take after screenshot & compare
npm run ui:after
npm run ui:compare
```

### Available Commands
```bash
npm run ui:before      # Capture current UI state (desktop + mobile)
npm run ui:after       # Capture updated UI state + auto-update component map
npm run ui:compare     # Visual comparison with pixel-perfect analysis
npm run ui:reset       # Clean workflow, start fresh
npm run ui:config      # Configure server URL settings
npm run ui:update-map  # Update component mapping
```

### Dependencies for Full Features
```bash
# Required for screenshot capture
npm install playwright

# Required for pixel-perfect visual comparison
npm install sharp
```

**In WSL (recommended):**
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install playwright sharp

npx playwright install chromium
```

**In Windows PowerShell/CMD:**
